          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 Healthcare Services: All of the Treating Providers who deliver
            Services through the Platform are independent professionals solely
            responsible for the services each provides to you. The Platform does
            not practice medicine or any other licensed profession and does not
            interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed
            profession by Treating Providers, each of whom is responsible for
            his or her services and compliance with the requirements applicable
            to his or her profession and license. Neither the Platform nor any
            third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to
            the Service shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain
            from a Treating Provider via the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 Informed Consent: The telehealth Services you receive from
            Treating Providers are not intended to replace a primary care
            physician relationship or be your permanent medical home. You should
            seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Treating
            Provider or when otherwise needed and continue to consult with your
            primary care physician and other healthcare professionals as
            recommended. You will have direct access to customer support
            services to follow up on medication reactions, side effects or other
            adverse events. Among the benefits of our Services are improved
            access to healthcare professionals and convenience. However, as with
            any health service, there are potential risks associated with the
            use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to:
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3.1 In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient
            (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate health
            care decision making by the Treating Provider;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3.2 Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures
            of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may be contacted
            by phone or other means of communication;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3.3 In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your health records
            may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or
            other judgment errors;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3.4 Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate
            network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and
            security of health information, in rare instances, security
            protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4 By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you acknowledge that
            you understand and agree with the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.1 You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits
            from the use of telehealth in your care, but that no results can be
            guaranteed or assured;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.2 Your Treating Provider may determine that the Services are not
            appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly
            may elect not to provide telehealth services to you through the
            Platform;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.3 With respect to psychotherapy, you are entitled to receive
            information from your Treating Provider about the methods of
            therapy, the techniques used, the duration of your therapy (if
            known), and the fee structure. You can seek a second opinion from
            another therapist or terminate therapy at any time;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.4 With respect to psychotherapy, if you and your Treating
            Provider decide to engage in group or couples therapy (collectively
            “Group Therapy”), you understand that information discussed in Group
            Therapy is for therapeutic purposes and is not intended for use in
            any legal proceedings involving Group Therapy participants. You
            agree not to subpoena the Treating Provider to testify for or
            against other Group Therapy participants or provide records in court
            actions against other Group Therapy participants;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.5 You understand that anything any Group Therapy participant
            tells the Treating Provider individually, whether on the phone or
            otherwise, may at the therapist’s discretion be shared with the
            other Group Therapy participants. You agree to share responsibility
            with the Treating Provider for the therapy process, including goal
            setting and termination;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.6 You can send messages to your Treating Provider by contacting
            Customer Support (by emailing to cs@netmeds.com). If you are
            experiencing a medical emergency, you should call the emergency
            ambulance number or go to the nearest emergency room;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.7 All communication between the Doctor/registered medical
            practitioners and you is a separate transaction which includes
            without any limitation all warranties related to consult and after
            consult services related to consult. We do not have any control over
            such information and play no determinative role in the finalization
            of the same and hence do not stand liable for the outcomes of such
            communication. We do not endorse any specific Doctor/registered
            medical practitioners on the Platform nor place any guarantee as to
            its quality and value. Any such recommendations that are done are
            done by other users and the Company does not verify or acknowledge
            the same;
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4.8 Further we may suggest treatments or services in accordance
            with your information within our knowledge but we do not guarantee
            any effectiveness or success upon using these services. Subject to
            the above sub-clauses, a contract exists between the
            Doctor/registered medical practitioners and you and as such any
            breach of contract and thus, any claim arising from such breach is
            the subject matter of the Doctor/registered medical practitioners
            and you and we are in no way a party to such breach or involved in
            any suit claim/negligence/damages etc arising from the same breach;
